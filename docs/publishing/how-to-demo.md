## Tips for Good Demos

### Keep It Short
- 5 minutes is ideal
- 10 minutes max
- Respect people's time

### Focus on the Story
- Problem → Solution → Value
- Not just "here's what I built"

### Handle Failures Gracefully
- If something breaks, acknowledge it
- Have a backup (screenshots)
- Don't panic

### Practice
- Run through at least 3 times
- Time yourself
- Get feedback before the real thing

### Be Authentic
- It's okay to say "I'm still learning"
- Share what was hard
- Show enthusiasm

## Recording Tips

### Setup
- Clean desktop
- Close notifications
- Good lighting (if showing face)
- Test audio

### During Recording
- Speak clearly
- Pause when clicking
- Explain what you're doing
- Don't rush

### Editing
- Trim silence
- Add captions (accessibility)
- Keep under 5 minutes
