## Common Mistakes

### Too Many Tutorials
**Problem**: Copying tutorials doesn't show your skills.
**Fix**: Build original projects, even if simpler.

### No Context
**Problem**: Code without explanation.
**Fix**: Every project needs a good README.

### Broken Links
**Problem**: Demo links don't work.
**Fix**: Test all links before sharing.

### Old/Abandoned Projects
**Problem**: Last commit 2 years ago.
**Fix**: Archive or update regularly.

### No Deployment
**Problem**: "Trust me, it works locally."
**Fix**: Deploy something, even if simple.
