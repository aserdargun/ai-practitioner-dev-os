## When to Learn Tier 3

### Prerequisites

Before tackling Tier 3, ensure you're solid on:
- Container fundamentals (Docker)
- Cloud platform basics (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Production deployment
- ML model serving
- Monitoring and observability

### Indicators You're Ready

- Consistently scoring 90+ at Intermediate
- Projects require distributed processing
- Performance optimization is necessary
- Working with large-scale systems

### Upgrade Path

```
/adapt-path

I've been scoring 90%+ for the past month and I'm ready to tackle
distributed systems and performance optimization. Should I upgrade to Advanced?
```

- AKS or EKS setup

### Month 3-4: Distributed Processing
- Kafka fundamentals
- Spark for ML
- Stream processing

### Month 5-6: Performance Optimization
- CUDA basics
- TensorRT optimization
- ONNX conversion

### Month 7-8: Advanced ML
- Reinforcement learning intro
- Federated learning concepts
- Graph neural networks

### Month 9-10: Scale Projects
