# Technology Tiers

Overview of the three-tier technology stack system.

## Tier Philosophy

The AI Practitioner Booster organizes 175 technologies into three tiers based on:
- **Foundational importance**: How essential for basic competency
- **Complexity**: Learning curve and prerequisites
- **Job readiness**: What employers expect at each level

---

## Tier Summary

| Tier | Name | Focus | Item Count | Learner Level |
|------|------|-------|------------|---------------|
| Tier 1 | Beginner Foundation | Core skills, fundamentals | 53 | Beginner |
| Tier 2 | Intermediate Shipping | Production skills | 95 | Intermediate |
| Tier 3 | Advanced Scale | Specialization | 27 | Advanced |

---

## Pace by Level

### Beginner
- **Scope**: Tier 1 only (53 items)
- **Timeline**: 12 months
- **Goal**: Solid fundamentals, first projects

### Intermediate
- **Scope**: Tier 1 + Tier 2 (148 items)
- **Timeline**: 12 months
- **Goal**: Ship production-quality work

### Advanced
- **Scope**: All tiers (175 items)
- **Timeline**: 12 months
- **Goal**: Scale, specialize, lead

## Using the Tiers

### During Setup
When you run `Execute @SETUP.md`:
- Choose your level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- System selects appropriate tiers
- Curriculum is generated accordingly

### During Learning
- Focus on your tier scope
- Don't skip ahead without completing fundamentals
- Tier 2 builds on Tier 1
- Tier 3 builds on Tier 2

### Customization
Use `MY_STACK.md` to:
- Check `[x]` only items you want
- Focus on specific areas
- Skip items you already know

---

## Progression

### Within a Tier
- Learn concepts, then apply
- Build projects using the technologies
- Master before moving on

### Between Tiers
- Complete your tier scope first
- Level change at month boundaries
- Consider upgrade when scores consistently >85
- Consider staying when gaps exist
