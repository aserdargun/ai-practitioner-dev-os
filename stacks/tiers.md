# Technology Tiers

How technologies are organized by learning level.

## Overview

Technologies are grouped into three tiers based on complexity and prerequisites:

| Tier | Level | Focus | Item Count |
|------|-------|-------|------------|
| Tier 1 | Beginner | Foundation | 53 items |
| Tier 2 | Intermediate | Shipping | 95 items |
| Tier 3 | Advanced | Scale/Performance | 27 items |
| **Total** | | | **175 items** |

---

## Tier Scope by Level

Levels are **cumulative**:

| Learner Level | Tiers Included | Total Items |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Beginner** | Tier 1 only | 53 items |
| **Intermediate** | Tier 1 + Tier 2 | 148 items |
| **Advanced** | Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 | 175 items |

## Tier Philosophy

### Tier 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Build solid fundamentals in data science and ML.

**Focus Areas**:
- Core programming (Python, SQL)
- Data manipulation and visualization
- Basic ML algorithms
- Statistical foundations
- Development tools

**Outcome**: Can explore data, build basic models, and use standard tools.

### Tier 2: Shipping

**Goal**: Build production-ready systems.

**Focus Areas**:
- ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- LLM and RAG development
- Cloud platforms
- Databases and data stores
- CI/CD and MLOps
- Monitoring and observability

**Outcome**: Can ship ML systems to production with proper engineering.

### Tier 3: Scale & Performance

**Goal**: Handle advanced scenarios.

**Focus Areas**:
- Distributed systems
- Container orchestration
- Performance optimization
- Advanced ML techniques
- Big data technologies

**Outcome**: Can build and scale complex ML infrastructure.

## Current Level: Intermediate

As an **Intermediate** learner, you work with **Tier 1 + Tier 2** technologies (148 items).

### What This Means

- You have access to foundational AND shipping-focused technologies
- Projects involve deploying to cloud/containers
- You learn production engineering practices
- LLM/RAG development is in scope

### What's Not In Scope (Tier 3)

These are deferred until Advanced level:
- Kubernetes and container orchestration
- Distributed processing (Kafka, Spark)
- Performance optimization (CUDA, TensorRT)
- Advanced ML (Federated Learning, RL)

## Progression

### Beginner → Intermediate

**Upgrade when**:
- Comfortable with Tier 1 technologies
- Consistently scoring 90+
- Ready for production engineering

**What changes**:
- Tier 2 technologies become active
- Projects involve cloud deployment
- LLM development is introduced

### Intermediate → Advanced

**Upgrade when**:
- Comfortable with Tier 1 + Tier 2
- Consistently scoring 90+
- Ready for scale and optimization

**What changes**:
- Tier 3 technologies become active
- Projects involve distributed systems
- Performance optimization is expected

## Customization

If using `MY_STACK.md`:
- Check only the items you want to focus on
- The system will use your selections within your tier scope
- Unchecked items in your tier scope become optional
