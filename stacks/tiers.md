# Tier Definitions

The AI Practitioner Learning OS organizes skills and technologies into three tiers. Your learner level determines which tiers you'll cover in 2026.

## Tier Overview

| Tier | Focus | Target |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Tier 1** | Foundation | Core data science and ML skills |
| **Tier 2** | Shipping | Production deployment and MLOps |
| **Tier 3** | Scale | Enterprise-grade systems |

## Pace by Level

Levels are **pace-based and cumulative**:

| Level | Tiers Covered | Focus for 2026 |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Beginner** | Tier 1 only | Master fundamentals |
| **Intermediate** | Tier 1 + Tier 2 | Ship to production |
| **Advanced** | Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 | Scale and optimize |

## Your Current Level: Beginner

As a Beginner, you'll focus exclusively on **Tier 1** skills throughout 2026. This provides a solid foundation that Tier 2 and Tier 3 build upon.

## Tier Details

### [Tier 1 - Foundation](tier-1-beginner.md)

**What you'll learn**:
- Python data science fundamentals
- Statistics and probability
- Machine learning basics
- Data analysis and visualization
- Basic web development (Flask/Django)

**Why it matters**:
Everything else builds on these skills. A strong Tier 1 foundation makes Tier 2 and Tier 3 much easier.

### [Tier 2 - Shipping](tier-2-intermediate.md)

**What you'll learn**:
- MLOps and DevOps basics
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Advanced ML (deep learning, NLP)
- RAG systems and LLMs
- Production deployment

**Why it matters**:
Most ML value comes from deployed models. Tier 2 teaches you to ship.

### [Tier 3 - Scale](tier-3-advanced.md)

**What you'll learn**:
- Kubernetes and container orchestration
- Distributed systems (Kafka, Spark)
- Performance optimization
- Advanced architecttic patterns
- Enterprise integration

**Why it matters**:
Enterprise systems need scale, reliability, and integration. Tier 3 prepares you for senior roles.

## Changing Levels

You can change levels through the adaptation system:

**Upgrade** (e.g., Beginner → Intermediate):
- Consistently score 90+ on evaluations
- Demonstrate strong understanding
- Happens at month boundaries

**Downgrade** (e.g., Intermediate → Beginner):
- Consistently struggle (score < 50)
- Need more time on fundamentals
- Happens at month boundaries

See [adaptation rules](../docs/evaluation/adaptation-rules.md) for details.
