## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Preferred:** Report privately via **GitHub Security Advisories** (repo → **Security** → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability** / **New draft advisory**)
   - If Security Advisories are not available, contact the maintainers using the public email listed on their GitHub profile.
2. Include details about the vulnerability
3. Allow time for a fix before public disclosure

We take security seriously and will respond promptly.
