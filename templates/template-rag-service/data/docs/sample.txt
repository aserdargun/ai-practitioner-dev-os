Welcome to the AI Practitioner Learning System

This document provides an overview of the learning system and its key features.

## What is this system?

The AI Practitioner Booster 2026 is an AI-driven, project-based learning system
designed to help you become a production-ready AI practitioner. It uses a
continuous feedback loop of Evaluate, Adapt, and Execute to optimize your
learning journey.

## Key Features

1. Structured Curriculum: 12-month program covering foundations to advanced topics
2. Project-Based Learning: Real projects that build your portfolio
3. AI-Driven Adaptation: The system adjusts based on your progress
4. Best Practices Capture: Learn and remember effective patterns

## How it Works

The system operates through commands that you invoke via Claude Code. These
commands trigger different agents (Planner, Builder, Reviewer, Evaluator, Coach)
to help you with various aspects of your learning journey.

## Getting Started

Start by checking your status with /status, then generate your weekly plan
with /plan-week. Work through the tasks, and run /retro at the end of the week
to reflect on your progress.
