{"query": "What is RAG?", "expected_answer": "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and grounded responses.", "expected_sources": ["rag_overview"]}
{"query": "How does vector search work?", "expected_answer": "Vector search finds similar items by comparing their numerical representations (embeddings) in high-dimensional space, typically using cosine similarity or euclidean distance.", "expected_sources": ["vector_search"]}
{"query": "What are embeddings?", "expected_answer": "Embeddings are dense numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning, enabling similarity comparisons between documents.", "expected_sources": ["embeddings_intro"]}
{"query": "How do you chunk documents?", "expected_answer": "Documents are split into smaller chunks with configurable size and overlap to enable more precise retrieval while maintaining context.", "expected_sources": ["chunking_strategy"]}
{"query": "What is semantic search?", "expected_answer": "Semantic search finds results based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches, using embeddings to understand query intent.", "expected_sources": ["semantic_search"]}
