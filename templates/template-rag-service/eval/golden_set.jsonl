{"query": "What is machine learning?", "expected_answer": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.", "relevant_docs": ["ml_basics.txt"], "category": "definition"}
{"query": "How does supervised learning work?", "expected_answer": "Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. The algorithm learns from input-output pairs to make predictions on new data.", "relevant_docs": ["ml_basics.txt", "supervised.txt"], "category": "concept"}
{"query": "What is the difference between classification and regression?", "expected_answer": "Classification predicts discrete categories or classes, while regression predicts continuous numerical values.", "relevant_docs": ["ml_types.txt"], "category": "comparison"}
{"query": "What is overfitting?", "expected_answer": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, resulting in poor performance on new unseen data.", "relevant_docs": ["training.txt"], "category": "definition"}
{"query": "How to prevent overfitting?", "expected_answer": "Overfitting can be prevented using techniques like cross-validation, regularization, early stopping, and increasing training data.", "relevant_docs": ["training.txt", "best_practices.txt"], "category": "how-to"}
