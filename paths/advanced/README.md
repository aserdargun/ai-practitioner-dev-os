## Evaluation Snapshot

Run evaluation:
```bash
python .claude/path-engine/evaluate.py
```

### Score Categories

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Completion | 40% | DoD items completed |
| Quality | 25% | Tests, code review |
| Velocity | 20% | Tasks vs plan |
| Reflection | 15% | Journals, retros |

**Threshold**: 70% to pass

Interpret results:
- ≥85%: Excellent, consider acceleration
- 70-84%: Passing, on track
- 55-69%: Needs attention, consider remediation
- <55%: Struggling, consider level change

## If You Are Stuck

### Step 1: Use the Coach
```
/debug-learning
```
Describe your blocker. Get targeted help.

### Step 2: Check Resources
- Best practices: `.claude/memory/best_practices.md`
- Skills playbooks: `.claude/skills/`
- Month README: `month-XX/README.md`

### Step 3: Ask for Research
```
"As the Researcher, help me understand [topic]"
```

### Step 4: Adjust the Plan
```
/plan-week "I need to reduce scope this week"
```

### Step 5: Request Adaptation
```
/adapt-path
```
Review proposals, apply if appropriate.

## Upgrade/Downgrade Rules

### Upgrade Triggers
Move from Intermediate → Advanced when:
- 3+ consecutive months ≥85%
- Consistently finishing early
- Ready for Tier 3 challenges

### Downgrade Triggers
Move from Advanced → Intermediate when:
- 2+ consecutive months <55%
- Tier 3 scope causing delays
- Want to consolidate Tier 1+2

### Process
1. Run `/evaluate` to confirm scores
2. Run `/adapt-path` to see proposal
3. Approve level change
4. Update `learner_profile.json`
5. Continue with new tier scope
