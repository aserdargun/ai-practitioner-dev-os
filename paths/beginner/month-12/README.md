1. **Scope ruthlessly** — Better to finish small than abandon big
2. **Start with deployment** — Deploy day 1, update continuously
3. **Get feedback early** — Show to friends, mentors, community
4. **Document as you go** — Don't save it for the end
5. **Celebrate completion** — You did a year of learning!
