# Month 4: Data Visualization

**Theme**: Tell compelling stories with data through effective visualization.

## Why It Matters

Data visualization is how you communicate insights. A great analysis means nothing if you can't explain it. Employers want people who can make data accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

## Prerequisites

- Month 3 completed (statistics foundation)
- Comfort with pandas DataFrames

## Learning Goals

### Static Visualization (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Matplotlib fundamentals
- [ ] seaborn for statistical plots
- [ ] Choosing the right chart type
- [ ] Color theory basics
- [ ] Annotations and labeling
- [ ] Multi-panel figures

### Interactive Visualization (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Plotly basics
- [ ] Interactive charts
- [ ] Plotly Express for quick plots
- [ ] Dashboards concepts
- [ ] Visualization best practices

## Main Project: Data Story Dashboard

Create a visualization portfolio piece that tells a story with data.

### Dataset
Choose an interesting public dataset:
- Sports statistics
- Economic indicators
- Climate data
- Health statistics
- Your choice!

### Deliverables
1. Static visualization report:
   - 5+ different chart types
   - Clear titles and labels
   - Consistent style
   - Exported as PDF/PNG

2. Interactive visualization:
   - At least 3 interactive charts
   - Filtering capability
   - Tooltips with details
   - Shareable HTML

3. Written narrative:
   - What story does the data tell?
   - Key insights highlighted
   - Methodology explained

### Definition of Done
- [ ] 5+ static visualizations
- [ ] 3+ interactive visualizations
- [ ] Clear story/narrative
- [ ] Proper labeling and legends
- [ ] Code is clean and documented
- [ ] Can present in 5 minutes

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Create a Streamlit mini-dashboard
- [ ] Add geographic visualizations
- [ ] Implement custom styling
- [ ] Add animation
- [ ] Create infographic-style summary

## Claude Prompts

### Planning
```
/plan-week
Month 4 Week 1 - Focus on Matplotlib
I want to create publication-quality charts
```

### Design Help
```
Ask the Researcher to explain which chart type
is best for showing change over time with
multiple categories.
```

### Building
```
Ask the Builder to help me create a seaborn
heatmap showing correlations between variables
with proper annotations.
```

### Review
```
Ask the Reviewer to critique my visualizations.
Are they clear? Any improvements for readability?
```

## How to Publish

### Demo
1. Show the dataset briefly
2. Present key visualizations
3. Walk through the story
4. Show interactive features
5. Highlight design choices

### Write-up Topics
- Why you chose these visualizations
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- What the data reveals
- Visualization techniques learned

### Portfolio Entry
- High-quality images
- Interactive HTML embeds
- Code notebook with explanations

## Tips

1. **Start with the question** — What are you trying to show?
2. **Less is more** — Don't overload charts with information
3. **Label everything** — Titles, axes, legends, units
4. **Test with others** — Can they understand without explanation?
5. **Iterate** — First draft is rarely best draft
