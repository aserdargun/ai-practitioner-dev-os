# Month 1: Environment & Python Basics

**Theme**: Set up your development environment and build Python fundamentals.

## Why It Matters

Every AI/ML journey starts with Python and proper tooling. This month builds the foundation everything else depends on. Companies expect data scientists and ML engineers to be fluent in Python and comfortable with development tools.

## Prerequisites

- Computer with internet access
- Basic computer literacy
- Motivation to learn!

## Learning Goals

### Tools & Environment (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Install and configure VS Code
- [ ] Set up Python environment (virtual environments)
- [ ] Learn Git basics (clone, commit, push, pull)
- [ ] Create GitHub account and first repository
- [ ] Install and use Jupyter notebooks

### Python Fundamentals (Week 2-4)
- [ ] Variables, data types, operators
- [ ] Control flow (if/else, loops)
- [ ] Functions and modules
- [ ] Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- [ ] File I/O
- [ ] Basic error handling
- [ ] Writing clean, readable code

## Main Project: Personal Expense Tracker

Build a command-line expense tracker in Python.

### Deliverables
1. Python script that can:
   - Add expenses (amount, category, date, description)
   - List all expenses
   - Filter by category or date range
   - Calculate totals and averages
   - Save/load from CSV file

2. Documentation:
   - README with usage instructions
   - Code comments explaining key parts

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] All 5 features implemented
- [ ] Data persists in CSV file
- [ ] README explains how to use
- [ ] Code is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Can demo in 3 minutes

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Add data validation (no negative amounts)
- [ ] Add monthly summary reports
- [ ] Create simple visualizations (print bar chart)
- [ ] Add expense categories autocomplete
- [ ] Write unit tests

## Claude Prompts

### Planning
```
/plan-week
Month 1 Week 1 - Focus on environment setup
I have [X] hours available
```

### Getting Help
```
Ask the Builder to help me implement the expense
filtering feature. I want to filter by category and date range.
```

### Code Review
```
Ask the Reviewer to review my expense tracker code.
Focus on Python best practices and code organization.
```

### Debugging
```
/debug-learning
I'm getting a FileNotFoundError when trying to load
the CSV file. Here's my code: [paste code]
```

## How to Publish

### Demo
1. Show the CSV file (empty initially)
2. Add a few expenses
3. List all expenses
4. Filter by category
5. Show the saved CSV file

### Write-up Topics
- Why I built this
- What I learned about Python
- Challenges and how I solved them
- What I'd do differently

### Portfolio Entry
- Push polished code to GitHub
- Write README with screenshots
- Add to your portfolio

## Tips

1. **Don't rush setup** — A solid environment saves hours later
2. **Commit often** — Small commits are easier to understand and revert
3. **Google is your friend** — Everyone looks things up
4. **Type the code** — Don't just copy-paste, typing builds muscle memory
5. **Break it, then fix it** — Experimentation is learning
