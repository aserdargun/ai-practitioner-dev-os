## Claude Prompts

### Planning
```
/plan-week

Starting Month 11 on agentic systems. I want to build a research assistant agent.
Help me plan the architecture and tool selection.
```

### Building
```
/ship-mvp

My agent has:
- Web search tool
- Calculator tool
- File reader tool
- Basic state management
What patterns should I add for reliable multi-step tasks?
```

### Debugging
```
/debug-learning

My agent keeps getting stuck in loops when a tool fails.
How do I add proper error recovery?
```

### Research
```
Researcher, what are the best practices for agent evaluation?
I need to test my agent's ability to complete complex tasks.
```

## How to Publish

### Demo
- Show complex task completion
- Demonstrate tool chaining
- Show error recovery

### Write-up
- "Building AI Agents: From Simple Tools to Complex Tasks"
- Include architecture diagram
- Share evaluation insights
