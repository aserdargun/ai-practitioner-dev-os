# Month 06: LLM Applications

**Focus**: Build applications with Large Language Models using LangChain.

---

## Why It Matters

LLMs are transforming how we build software. Understanding how to work with APIs, chains, and prompts is essential for building modern AI applications. This month introduces the patterns you'll use extensively in RAG and agent development.

**Job Relevance**: Extremely high demand; core skill for AI/ML engineers in 2026.

## Claude Prompts

### Planning
```
/plan-week

Starting Month 6 on LLM applications. I want to build a customer service chatbot.
Help me plan the LangChain learning and implementation.
```

### Building
```
/ship-mvp

My chatbot has:
- Conversation memory
- 3 prompt templates
- Basic chain for Q&A
What should I add for MVP?
```

### Review
```
/harden

Review my chatbot for:
- Prompt injection risks
- Cost efficiency
- Response quality
- Error handling
```

### Research
```
Researcher, what are the best practices for prompt engineering?
I want to improve my chatbot's response quality.
```
