# Month 4: Data Visualization

**Focus**: Create compelling visualizations that tell stories with data

---

## Why It Matters

Visualization is how you communicate insights to stakeholders. The best analysis is worthless if you can't convey it effectively. Employers expect:
- Clear, professional visualizations
- Appropriate chart selection
- Dashboard creation skills
- Data storytelling ability

---

## Prerequisites

- Months 1-3 completed
- pandas proficiency
- Basic statistics understanding

---

## Learning Goals

By the end of this month, you will:

1. **Matplotlib**
   - [ ] Figure and axes objects
   - [ ] Line, scatter, bar, histogram plots
   - [ ] Customizing appearance
   - [ ] Subplots and layouts

2. **Seaborn**
   - [ ] Statistical visualizations
   - [ ] Distribution plots
   - [ ] Categorical plots
   - [ ] Heatmaps and pair plots

3. **Plotly**
   - [ ] Interactive charts
   - [ ] Hover information
   - [ ] Animations
   - [ ] Dash basics

4. **Visualization Principles**
   - [ ] Choosing the right chart
   - [ ] Color theory basics
   - [ ] Avoiding misleading graphics
   - [ ] Accessibility considerations

---

## Main Project: Interactive Dashboard

Build an interactive dashboard that tells a story with data.

### Deliverables

1. **Dashboard** (Streamlit or Dash)
   - At least 5 different visualizations
   - Interactive filters/controls
   - Responsive layout
   - Clear narrative flow

2. **Static report** (`report.pdf`)
   - Key insights highlighted
   - Publication-quality charts
   - Executive summary

3. **Source code**
   - Well-organized structure
   - Reusable visualization functions
   - Documentation

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Dashboard is interactive and responsive
- [ ] Visualizations are clear and appropriate
- [ ] Story is coherent
- [ ] Code is reusable
- [ ] Deployed (locally or cloud)
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Project Ideas

- Sales performance dashboard
- COVID-19 data explorer
- Personal finance tracker
- Sports statistics dashboard
- Environmental data visualization

---

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or Heroku
- [ ] Add drill-down capabilities
- [ ] Include animated transitions
- [ ] Make it mobile-responsive
