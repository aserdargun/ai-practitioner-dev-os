# Month 1: Python & Environment Setup

**Focus**: Establish your development environment and Python fundamentals

---

## Why It Matters

Every AI/ML role requires strong Python skills. Setting up a proper development environment early prevents hours of debugging later. Employers expect:
- Clean, readable Python code
- Familiarity with development tools
- Version control proficiency
- Reproducible environments

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Willingness to learn
- 8-10 hours per week available

---

## Learning Goals

By the end of this month, you will:

1. **Development Environment**
   - [ ] VS Code configured with Python extensions
   - [ ] Git installed and configured
   - [ ] Python 3.11+ with virtual environments
   - [ ] Jupyter notebooks running

2. **Python Fundamentals**
   - [ ] Variables, data types, operators
   - [ ] Control flow (if/else, loops)
   - [ ] Functions and modules
   - [ ] File I/O basics

3. **Best Practices**
   - [ ] Git workflow (commit, push, pull)
   - [ ] Code formatting (Black/ruff)
   - [ ] Basic debugging
   - [ ] Writing readable code

---

## Main Project: Personal Automation Script

Build a script that automates something in your daily life.

### Deliverables

1. **Python script** (`automation.py`)
   - Solves a real problem you have
   - Uses at least 3 functions
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Includes comments

2. **README.md**
   - What the script does
   - How to run it
   - Example usage

3. **Tests** (`test_automation.py`)
   - At least 3 test cases
   - Tests pass with pytest

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] Handles edge cases
- [ ] README is clear and complete
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Code is formatted (ruff/black)
- [ ] Committed to Git with good messages

### Project Ideas

- File organizer (sort downloads by type)
- Backup script (copy important files)
- Text processor (find/replace in files)
- Simple task tracker (CLI todo list)
- Weather notifier (fetch and display weather)

---

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Add command-line arguments (argparse)
- [ ] Create a simple GUI (tkinter)
- [ ] Publish as a pip-installable package
- [ ] Add CI with GitHub Actions

---
