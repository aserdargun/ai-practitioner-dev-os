# Month 03: ML Fundamentals

**Tier**: 1 (Foundations)
**Duration**: 4 weeks
**Status**: ⏳ Upcoming

---

## Objectives

By the end of this month, you will:

1. Train and evaluate ML models
2. Understand the ML workflow end-to-end
3. Implement proper train/val/test splits
4. Track experiments effectively

- [ ] Create reproducible experiments

**Deliverables**:
- Experiment tracking setup
- First logged experiment

### Week 2: Classification

**Focus**: Build classification models

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement logistic regression
- [ ] Try tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- [ ] Understand classification metrics
- [ ] Handle imbalanced classes

**Deliverables**:
- Classification pipeline
- Model comparison report

### Week 3: Regression

**Focus**: Build regression models

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement linear regression
- [ ] Try ensemble methods
- [ ] Understand regression metrics (MSE, MAE, R²)
- [ ] Feature importance analysis

**Deliverables**:
- Regression pipeline
- Feature importance analysis

### Week 4: ML Project

**Focus**: End-to-end ML project

**Tasks**:
