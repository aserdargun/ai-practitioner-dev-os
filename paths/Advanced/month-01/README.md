## Project Ideas

Choose one for Week 4:

1. **CSV Processor**: Read, validate, and transform CSV data
2. **Config Manager**: Load and validate application configuration
3. **Log Analyzer**: Parse and summarize log files
4. **API Client**: Simple client for a public API

---

## Success Criteria

## Tips for This Month

1. **Don't rush**: Foundations matter. Take time to understand.
2. **Use the commands**: `/status`, `/plan-week`, `/ship-mvp`
3. **Ask for help**: Use `/debug-learning` if stuck
4. **Capture learnings**: Add best practices as you discover them
