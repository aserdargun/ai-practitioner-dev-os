## Getting Started

### Start with why, then how
*Captured: Day 1 | Source: Setup*

Before diving into code or tools, understand why you're learning something. Connect each skill to your goals. This makes learning stick and helps prioritize.

### Document as you go, not after
*Captured: Day 1 | Source: Setup*
