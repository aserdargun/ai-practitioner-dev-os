## Getting Started

### Read Before You Code
**Context**: Starting any new project or module

## Data Analysis

### Check Data Quality First
**Context**: Starting any data project
**Practice**: Run missing value check, duplicate check, and type validation before analysis
**Why**: Prevents wasted time on flawed analysis

### Document Your Assumptions
**Context**: Making decisions during EDA
**Practice**: Write down assumptions about data as you make them
**Why**: Makes it easier to validate later and explain to others
**Added**: 2026-01-01

## Code Quality

### Write Tests Early
**Context**: Building new functionality
**Practice**: Write at least one test before or while implementing
**Why**: Catches bugs early, makes refactoring safer
**Added**: 2026-01-01

### Keep Functions Small

## Learning

### Use the Commands
**Context**: Any time you feel stuck or uncertain
**Practice**: Use `/status`, `/debug-learning`, or `/evaluate` to get oriented
**Why**: Claude can help diagnose issues and suggest next steps
**Added**: 2026-01-01

### Reflect Weekly
**Context**: End of each week
**Practice**: Run the post-week review hook and honestly reflect
**Why**: Reflection accelerates learning by identifying patterns
**Added**: 2026-01-01

## Productivity

### Time Box Experiments
**Context**: Trying new approaches or debugging
**Practice**: Set a time limit before trying; if stuck, ask for help
**Why**: Prevents rabbit holes, gets you unstuck faster
**Added**: 2026-01-01

### One Thing at a Time
**Context**: Daily work
**Practice**: Focus on one task until done before starting another
**Why**: Context switching is expensive; completion builds momentum
**Added**: 2026-01-01
