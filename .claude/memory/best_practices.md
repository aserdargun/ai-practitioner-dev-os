## General

### Start with the Simplest Solution
> Begin with the simplest approach that could work. Add complexity only when needed. A working simple solution beats a sophisticated broken one.
>
> *When*: Starting any new feature or project
> *Source*: System initialization

### Document Decisions
> When making a significant decision, log it to `decisions.jsonl` with rationale and alternatives considered. Future you will thank present you.
>
> *When*: Architectural choices, technology selections, trade-off decisions
> *Source*: System initialization

---

## Testing

### Test Early, Not Just at the End
> Write tests as you build, not after. Catching issues early saves debugging time later. Aim for tests within the same day as implementation.
>
> *When*: Any implementation work
> *Source*: System initialization

---

## Learning

### Time-Box Research
> Set a timer when researching. 2 hours max before asking for help or making a decision. Endless research is a productivity trap.
>
> *When*: Exploring new technologies, debugging unfamiliar issues
> *Source*: System initialization

### Capture Learnings Immediately
> When you learn something valuable, write it down immediately. Use `/add-best-practice` before context fades.
>
> *When*: After solving a tricky problem, after a retrospective
> *Source*: System initialization

## Project Management

### Weekly Retrospectives
> End each week with a brief retrospective. What went well? What didn't? What will you do differently? Even 10 minutes helps.
>
> *When*: End of each week
> *Source*: System initialization
